Welcome to FesTiPhus--FTP for the rest of us!

To install FesTiPhus on your Linux box:

1. Clone this repo or download and unpack the zip
2. Open up a terminal and say:
   pip install pyftpdlib
3. If you're behind a network address translator (you probably are) you'll need to
   set port forwarding on your router. For the external start and end ports, choose
   ports 3000 and 3001, respectively. Choose the same for the internal start and end
   ports. For the internal IP address, choose the LAN address of your machine
   (probably beginning with 192.168.1--use ifconfig to find it). (PNP port forwarding
   coming soon!)
4. There's no step 4!

Using Festiphus:
1. In the terminal, cd to wherever you unzipped or cloned the project and say:
   python bin/festiphus.py
2. You'll be greeted with two dialog boxes in succession. In the first, state your
   FesTiPhus nameserver (most likely the default) and in the second, the username
   you'd like to pick.
3. To grant access to a user, type their username and a password in the second row
   of inputs. (To communicate this information, I've found cans and a string work
   well.) Files you want to share with them should be placed in the folder
   bin/ftproot
4. To log into someone else's ftp folder, input their name and the password they set
   for you in the first row of boxes. Hit connect.
